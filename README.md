# React 2019 Interactive Workbook

### React Hooks? Context? Lazy? Memo? Who has time to learn about all of this stuff?

(Ok, I have the time, I just fear change.)

Just reading the docs without putting your new knowledge into practice isn't a great way to learn, so I've made a few practice tasks that should give you some concrete experience implementing these new(ish) patterns.

## How to get started

Either [fork the CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/aholachek/react-interactive-workbook) (recommended approach) or fork this repo and run `yarn` and `yarn start`.

Next, click on a task in the menu and follow the instructions! Each task should take between 5 and 25 minutes to complete. For most tasks, you'll see three cards:

1. A set of instructions
2. A non-working component that you must fix by editing the files in the relevant folder
3. An example of the component in it's final, working state.

If you get confused, search for the `TODO` comments in the code, or (if you must) take a peek at the `answers` folder in each task.
