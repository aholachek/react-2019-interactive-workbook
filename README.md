# React 2019 Interactive Workbook

React Hooks? Context? Lazy? Memo? Error Boundaries?

Who has time to learn about all this new stuff?

(Ok, I have the time, I just fear change.)

The workbook consists of a series of tasks that will get you quickly up to speed on the basics of some new(ish) React patterns.

## How to get started

Either [fork on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/aholachek/react-interactive-workbook?module=/src/1_Context/ThemeProviderContainer.js) or fork this repo and run `yarn` and `yarn start`.

Next, click on a task in the menu and follow the instructions! Each task should take between 5 and 30 minutes to complete. For most tasks, you'll see three cards:

1. A set of instructions that you can complete by checking them off.
2. A non-working component that you must fix by editing the files in the relevant folder.
3. An example of the component in its final, working state.

If you get confused, search for the `TODO` comments in the code, or (if you must) take a peek at the `answers` folder in each task.
