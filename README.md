Who has time to learn about all this new stuff?

This workbook consists of a series of tasks that will get you quickly up to speed on the basics of the following new(ish) React patterns:

- Context
- Memo
- Lazy
- Portals
- Hooks
- Error Boundaries

Here's what it looks like:

## How to get started

Either [fork on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/aholachek/react-2019-interactive-workbook?module=/src/1_Context/ThemeProviderContainer.js) or fork this repo and run `yarn` and `yarn start`.

**Note:** Doing the project locally instead of in CodeSandbox will result in a
better experience, since the <code>React.lazy</code> and
<code>ErrorBoundary</code> tasks will exhibit more realistic browser
behavior.

Next, click on a task in the menu and follow the instructions! Each task should take between 5 and 30 minutes to complete. For most tasks, you'll see three cards:

1. A set of instructions that you can complete by checking them off.
2. A non-working component that you must fix by editing the files in the relevant folder.
3. An example of the component in its final, working state.

If you get confused, search for the `TODO` comments in the code, or take a peek at the `answers` folder in each task.
